Files created:
- index.html         (homepage)
- shop.html          (shop + add to cart)
- style.css          (shared styling)
- script.js          (cart logic, localStorage)

Notes:
- Place product images and logo in an 'images' folder next to these files:
  images/1.jpg        (logo)
  images/hero.jpg     (hero background)
  images/product1.jpg
  images/product2.jpg
  images/product3.jpg
  images/product4.jpg

- The cart uses localStorage (key: 'bml_cart_v1') so items persist across reloads.
- Checkout is a demo alert. To accept payments you must integrate a payment provider/server.
